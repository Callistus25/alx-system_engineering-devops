## Shell, basics and script descriptions ##

An introductory crash course in the Shell on how to navigate directories using `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, how to look around using `ls`, `less`, and `file`, and how to manipulate files with `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `mkdir`. Further practices includes working with the `type`, `which`, `help`, and `man` commands, implementing `wildcards`, reading `man` pages, creating links, and using keyboard shortcuts in Bash.
