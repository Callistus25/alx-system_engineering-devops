## System Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting

This repository are programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at Alx S.E school. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. This repository holds all the codes for each of the projects carried out in the course of the ALX Software Engineering training program. Projects are as listed below:

- [0x00. Shell, basics](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/main/0x00-shell_basics)
